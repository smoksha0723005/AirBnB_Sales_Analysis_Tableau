# Airbnb Sales Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb sales data to gain insights into pricing trends, booking patterns, and revenue generation across different regions and property types. This interactive Tableau dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncovering opportunities for optimization in Airbnb listings.

## 2. Key Questions & KPIs
#### Key Questions:
1. What is the average price per bedroom across different listings?
2. How do Airbnb prices vary by ZIP code?
3. What is the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms?
4. How has Airbnb revenue trended throughout the year?
5. Which ZIP codes have the highest and lowest average prices?

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Average Price per Bedroom: Price trend segmented by the number of bedrooms.
2. Price by Zip Code: Regional analysis of listing prices.
3. Total Listings by Bedroom Count: Volume of available properties based on size.
4. Revenue for the Year: Weekly trend in cumulative revenue generation.
5. Price Heatmap by Zip Code: Visual representation of ZIP code-wise pricing patterns.

## 3. Process
Data Collection: Gathered Airbnb sales dataset, including property details, pricing, location (ZIP code), and booking history.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to remove nulls, duplicates, and anomalies.
Data Transformation: Aggregated data for price per bedroom, ZIP code segmentation, and weekly revenue calculation.
Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive Tableau dashboard, incorporating visualizations such as bar charts, maps, and trend lines.

## 4. Project Insights
Price by Bedroom: Average price increases with the number of bedrooms, ranging from $96 for 1-bedroom to $584 for 6-bedroom properties.
Listings Count: The majority of listings are 1- and 2-bedroom properties, with fewer large homes available.
Price by ZIP Code: ZIP code 98119 has the highest average price, while ZIP code 98178 has the lowest.
Revenue Trend: Revenue shows consistent growth throughout the year, with a peak around May and stability afterward.
Geographical Variation: The heatmap highlights pricing clusters, showing higher prices in central and popular ZIP codes.

## 5. Final Conclusion
The Airbnb Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of pricing trends, listing distribution, and revenue performance. The insights reveal that pricing is heavily influenced by bedroom count and ZIP code location. Revenue remains stable after a mid-year peak, indicating a strong booking trend throughout the year. These findings enable stakeholders to strategize listing pricing, target high-demand regions, and optimize occupancy rates for improved profitability.
